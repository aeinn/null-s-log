### Look Back Movie
Went to watched the fan screening of [Look Back](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31711040/) in my country. The fan ticket has included some (limited?) merch for the show, but unlucky for me, the poster which I received has slight fold crease that I don't think it was intentional :(. 

I really enjoyed watching Look Back. It is short, sweet, and melancholic.\
Might be the first time I've seen a cinema room thats almost fully occupied.

### Table Plant
I finally gotten myself a table plant. Will try to keep it alive as long as possible.\
While still writing this, I just realised that I don't even know the name(species) of this plant.\
Might be a good idea to learn more about the name and characteristic of this plant if I really want it to stay for long.
