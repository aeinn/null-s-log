### Room Wallpaper Deco
I went to bought a frame for the Lookback wallpaper I got and hang it in my room. This is actually the first time I've hanged/display a wallpaper in my room, and NGL, it's now my most favourite thing in my room. Feels childish to be nerding out like this but displaying the wallpaper made me feels very cool and stylish.

### Starting bare-metal Linux
Previously, I made a linux VM using Microsoft's Hyper-V because I wanted a seperated environment to host all the programming softwares. I personally think it is annoying to see all the dependencies or softwares that is required to downloads together with the programming language/compiler/IDE to show up in the apps list together with all the games I've downloaded as it makes me feels like my PC is bloated.

Generally, my experiences with running VM on Windows is... fine, except for one thing:\
My personal PC is mounted with 16GB of RAM. While idling, windows it self would use about 4GB(25%) of it. But when starting up the VM, eventhough it's Linux, my RAM usage will jump up to 15GB(95%) usage. This means that the Linux VM took 11GB(70%) of RAM usage, 3 times the RAM usage of idling Windows, huh????

Oh well, so now I've decided to finally try bare-metal Linux using a 2nd hand thinkpad I bought, albeit I'm still dual booting it with Windows (>_<).\
Took some time to setup, especially the most challenging parts I think is trying to use software to flash(?) a usb for booting Linux.


# Japanese Learning Progresss
- No progress today, cause I wanted to do this log first. I'll probably go study some vocab after I'm done with this log.
- Learned new grammar yesterday regarding conjugate(?) adjectives to be opposites, and chaining adjectives. But I actually cant recall what I learned right now
