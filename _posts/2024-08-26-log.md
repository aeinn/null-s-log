While learning Japanese kanji, as a native mandarin speaker,
I could recognise the meaning of kanji before even memorising the kana readings of the voacabulary,
which may or may not be a problem.

I would often answer the vocab quiz meaning correctly before even properly remembering the kana readings, which I think moots the point of training because I pass the test even when I still haven't properly memorise the kana reading


# Japanese Learning Progresss
- Learned 9 new vocab
- Learned the grammar of „ÅÆ


# Problem(s)
- Just discoverd that inputting the symbol of ('") is somehow being converted to (:*). Some of the symbols also appear to have the same problem while some symbols works correctly. I had to press all of the symbols key to find the symbols I wanted when writing this log.
