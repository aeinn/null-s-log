# Money Worry
Recently I damaged my glass due to my own messy-ness/lazyness. So I have to pay the price(literally) and get myself a new pair of glass.\
And today, I had to send my car to workshop to fix it due to something broke causing it to release loud vibrations noise when starting and accelerating.\
Feels like each month I always have something something that I need to pay for just to maintain my QoL.

My savings for last month droped because I used it to get a new phone. This month, no matter what, I need to make sure my saving must increase.

# Future Job/Path Worry
I like my current job, it pays decent, its close to my home, its not stressful, and I really like the task (coding). Even so, I got two things that I'm not really satisfied with:
- I dont think my pay can go much higher and I still feel like theres a lot of stuff that I wanted to do but is being limited by my financial ability (and currency strength in my country). 
- I think its very hard for me to improve my ability both inside and outside of my job scope. I worry that past certain age, I would lose all my competitive advantage against ppl thats in the same field as me.

To summarize, its literally just about getting better money/oppurtunity. Extremely priveledge, I know right ðŸ˜…?

# Japanese Learning Progresss
Still on-going progress, but with some challenges:
- The learning app I used rn mainly only test vocabs in hiragana/katakana, so my kanji knowledge proficientcy is lacking
- With increasing grammar rule which I learned, its harder now for me to keep track on all the rules I learned. Especially grammar that I wasn't able to fully master like ichidan/godan is very confusing to me now.
