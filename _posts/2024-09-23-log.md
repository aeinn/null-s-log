# Last Week
- Beat/completed the final boss of black myth wukong
- Went to Ikea because I was nearby it. Walking around the demo room really tempts me wanting to buy some of the furniture. But the items that looks great are all so expensive (Q-Q). But in the end I went and a bought a new chair for my room and some baskets.
- Finally gotten my team in company to do a meeting/training that I had requested for 2 months. Unfortunately the time available is very limited, I was only able to share very few topics. I really hope that we can do more knowledge sharing sessions, and I really wish that my colleague could have at least some passion in coding and could share their own knowledge/topics to me as well

# Trapezium
Went to watched an anime movie named Trapezium last Saturday.

## My thoughts:
