Had a pretty fine week, same daily routine, not a lots of things I did out of the ordinary.
I'm back to old habit of spending my work off time with games and skipping logs... I've let myself down >.<

Fortunately, theres some silver lining:
- I still do my japanese learning dailies.
- I've signed myself up for events this weekend, something I don't usually do, look forward to it >_o

# Rant
Did an oopsie recently, bought movie ticket in wrong date by mistake via online booking.\
I wrote an email to the cinema company, to plea for them to consider refund. The email was just sent not long ago, I'm hoping/praying they'll be kind to my request.

# Japanese Learning Progresss
- more new vocabs
- grammar rule for connecting object/time/places with verbs using を/に/で
