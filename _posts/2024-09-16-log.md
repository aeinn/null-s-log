# Event: Level Up Play 2024
So, the past 2 days, I have signed myself up as a volunteer in an ACG event.\
In this event, there's a total of 4 seperate halls, and each halls has a different theming. The organization I'm volunteering for belongs to the hall of **content creator** which focus on our **locals** content creator. In this hall, the content are also being sub-categorised into 3 section:
- Freelancer Zone
- Comic Zone
- Vtuber Zone

The zone which we are responsible for is the Vtuber Zone. In this zone, our local Vtubers were given the oppurtunity to advertise themself, and even interact with event participants.

## Thoughts on event
Overall, I think this event is great. Personally, I get starry eyes to see different artists each showcasing their own unique styles. Besides that, it introduced me to some interesting organization/studio that I never knew about. I also think that it is objectively a great event for helping our local artist to introduce themself to the public.

## Thoughts on volunteering
Now, to the most important topic.
### Why did I decided to volunteer
- I'm a closet weeb, and always wanted to attend an ACG event
- It gives me an oppurtunity to socialise
- I'm curious about what happens behind the scenes during the operation of an event
- I think it'll be beneficial by providing trainings/experiences to develop skill sets tree that is completely different to what I'm already familiar
- It strokes my ego by making me feels like I'm a part of something "big"

### How do I feel during the volunteer process
The task assigned are usually light work stuff like looking after booth, fetch items, looking after everyone belongings etc. Initially, I think I have a problem of being too up-tight about the task/roles assigned to me, but I think I were able to slowly ease up little by little during the 2nd day of the event.\
Generally I still get nervous when trying to talk to others, but I think for once I'm actually doing ok while communicating with others during this event. I manage to help visitors that comes to my booth, I manage to held a conversation with another volunteer that is assigned with me, I were even able to approach participants from other booth and ask them to introduce me about their contents. 

### What do I feel after the volunteer ended
Eventhough I'm aware that volunteer work does not get compensated, but man, having to pay the transport and parking fee out of my own pockets hurts me slightly. In a car centric country, parking fee without max cap is actually crazy.\
Another thing that disappointed me, during the end of the event, it didn't really feel like I'm part of the event crews. In the final group photo for all the event crews, I can't help but feels like I self insert myself into the photo instead of being part of it. As mentioned above, volunteers were only assigned with light works and I did not feel like I did anything substantial for the event and feel being left out. Part of the reason which cause this problem is that eventhough I have some ok interactions with the event crew, I wasn't able to create any meaningful relationship/connection with them, nor did I gain any skills which I was expecting in the begining.

Can't really describe the somber feeling I had, when traveling back home alone after the event ended.


# Update
Previous log I mentioned about a plea of refund request due to mistake purchase of cinema tickets, they actually responded kindly to my request, even emphasize to me that the decision to refund was an exception to their common practice. I'm definitely grateful for that.
