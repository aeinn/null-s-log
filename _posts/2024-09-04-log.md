### New figure addition
The Pop Up Parade figure of Mitsumi x Shima (Skip and Loafer) I had pre-ordered has finally arrived!!\
Skip and Loafer is the first romance anime that I wanted to rate 10/10, and buying it's figure is my way of supporting the author. Hopefully I could collect their manga too one day.

### Manga Hunting/Collecting
Since yesterday, I have been trying to browse for mangas in order to build my manga collections. After a lots of searching, I'm slightly dissapointed to discover that there isn't a lot of options available in my country.\
The store which has the most complete collection of translated manga, source most of the manga from US publisher, which makes it very expensive. Collecting a full sets manga from any series (10+ volumes) would cost almost the same price of getting a 1/7 scaled figure (180 USD).

Hate myself that the first comparison I thought of is another weeb collection hobby. I used to live frugally in the past, but lately I feel like my sense of money has been broken.

Well, anyway, back to topic. There is cheaper options from different publisher, but unfortunately these publisher's library is usually limited.\
One more problem related to this option is that sometimes old volume from same series would be sold out or out of print, making it impossible to complete your collections... sigh
