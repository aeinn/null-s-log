Been a while since I last update my logs. Currently, While writing this log, I realise that I'm so bad at remembering things I've did in past days. Or maybe the problem was I didn't did anything remarkable because I wasted times playing Wukong, and even skip logging. 

Anyway, my main highlight for previous week was... I finally caved in and bought a new phone for myself. I've been eyeing to get a Google Pixel for about 2 years, but didn't had the heart to splurge in the past until recently.

So far, I'm enjoying the performance of Pixel, but that was a given because my previous phone was a budget phone and can't really compete.

# Japanese Learning Progresss
- didn't keep tracks of how many new vocabs I had learned since last update
- learned the grammar of question sentence, and the words which makes the question such as: なん/なに、だれ、どこ

> tho I think I might have forgot something from old lesson because I got confused by two of the following sentences:
> - すきスポーツはなんですか？
> - なにスポーツがすきですか？

> Not even sure if I wrote the sentences correctly
