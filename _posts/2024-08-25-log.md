Missed my log yesterday and broke my daily log streak.

Recently bought and played Black Myth: Wukong. I think the game is decently enjoyable.

But man, I fear that this would be a start of a slippy slope journey of me losing all the momentum I had finally build. I'm even struggling just now to get myself motivated to continue on with learning JP and writing this log. 

Today is a Sunday, which I could have used the time had in learning more in Japanese and adding content in this blog but instead felt like I had just wasted it.

# Japanese Learning Progresss
- Learned the rest of katakana combination rules except for the special cases section
- Tried learning basic japanese words from renshuu android app, which included 20 vocab per sessions. My first sets of vocabs are mostly vocab which I already knew, so it isn't that challenging. While doing the test, I found that the options provided in the multi selections is too easy to identify the correct answers even when I couldn't recall the term when prompt. Really wonder if this could be helpful.
