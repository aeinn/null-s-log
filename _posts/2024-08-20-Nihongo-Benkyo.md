# Day {{" "}}{%- include /functions/f_dateDifference.html date1=page.date date2=site.dateStartedLearningJapanese -%}
- memorised katakana for サ and タ column

### Unrelated notes 1
1st time using linux - Ubuntu (via VM).
Tried to install japanese input, which proceed succesfully.

Tested typing japanese in text editor and manage to input japanese succesfully, but when typing it in VS Code, it ignored the japanese input and could only input in english.

I still manage to add in the japanese character in this file by first typing the character in text editor and copy paste it into VS Code.

Rough google couldn't find the problem yet, will continue troubleshoot when available.

### Unrelated note 2
Implemented a mechanism for calculating days since started learning japanese using a rather hacky method for jekyll.
The current implementation method is inspired from [Using Jekyll _includes as custom liquid functions](https://hamishwillee.github.io/2014/11/13/jekyll-includes-are-functions/)

I believe that my current implementation is flawed and can be improved.

### rant
I felt like I might be too greedy attempting to do all things I'm not familiar with all in the same time
- learning japanese
- using linux
- using jekyll

all while carrying the feelings of wanting to attempt more activities, such as improve drawings, make game, learn music, improve current blog design, improve my social etc

oh man, sudden feeling of time being limited
