I've decided to change the direction of my future post.
Instead of just recording my JP study progress, I'd like to make this my daily log instead where I'll write about mundane daily stuff haha.

I will still include my JP study progress in future daily log, just that it won't be main focus of a post.


# Japan Learning Progress
- Learned the katakana　ハ, マ, ヤ　column


# Updates
I've solved a problem that was mentioned in my previous log regarding issue with switching input language in VS Code,
refer: [this post]({% post_url 2024-08-20-Nihongo-Benkyo %})


At first I assumed the problem was due to incorrect setup on linux, but it turns out to be a incorrect behaviour of VS Code.
The problem and solution can be found here: [vscode github issue report](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/96041)
