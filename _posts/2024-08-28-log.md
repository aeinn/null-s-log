Missed my log and daily studies yesterday because I was playing Wukong.
Got fixated trying to beat the Yellow Wind Sage which took about 3 hours.
The boss fight design is kinda bs ngl.

Took me a while, but I finally gotten the right pose and angle for a figma of mine. She was posing uncanny for a long time before I finally got it to look right today.

Trying to make a figure pose to looks good and natural is actually quite difficult.

# Japanese Learning Progresss
- Learned 20 new vocabs
- Learned the grammar of adjectives い and な. Though the training didn't provide sufficient sample for な case.
