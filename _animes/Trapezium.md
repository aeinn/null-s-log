Right at the start of the movie, when the main character is introduced, I didn't really like the main characters personality and think that her goal is very shallow, which I attributed it to bad writing. But soon in the middle of the movie, I understand that the settings wasn't due to bad writing, but instead it was a deliberate choice to make the main character not as likeable. I think it manages to gives me a sense of novelty as it is very rarely to see fiction that are willing to make the main character detestable without justifying her action.

Unfortunately, I don't really like ending as the forgiveness which the main character got is too early and does not feel earned. I personally would like it more if it could end in a bitter sweet ending where the main character have to move on with life bearing the guilt, but was able to grow from her mistake and only earn the forgiveness once the time is right.

Overall, besides the ending, I think the movie is decent.
